# SECURITY CONFIGURATION NOTES
# ===================================================================
#
# Dependabot automatically creates security updates for:
# - Direct dependencies with known vulnerabilities
# - Indirect dependencies with known vulnerabilities (when possible)
#
# Security updates will bypass the normal schedule and grouping rules
# and will be created immediately when vulnerabilities are detected.
#
# For this repository, pay special attention to:
# - express: Web framework with potential security implications
# - node-fetch: HTTP client library
# - ws: WebSocket library
# - puppeteer-core: Browser automation (potential security risks)
# - lighthouse: Audit tool with browser interaction
#
# ===================================================================
# MAINTENANCE NOTES
# ===================================================================
#
# 1. Review and merge dependency updates regularly
# 2. Test thoroughly before merging, especially for:
#    - Major version updates
#    - Security-related packages
#    - Browser automation dependencies
#
# 3. Consider pinning critical dependencies if stability is paramount
# 4. Monitor for breaking changes in MCP SDK updates
# 5. Update this configuration as the repository structure evolves
#
