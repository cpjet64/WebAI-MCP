Tool: runAuditMode_webai
Command: runAuditMode_webai()
Parameters: None

Output:
I want you to enter "Audit Mode". Use the following MCP tools one after the other in this exact sequence:

1. runAccessibilityAudit
2. runPerformanceAudit
3. runBestPracticesAudit
4. runSEOAudit
5. runNextJSAudit (only if our application is ACTUALLY using NextJS)

After running all of these tools, return back a comprehensive analysis of the audit results.

Do NOT use runNextJSAudit tool unless you see that our application is ACTUALLY using NextJS.

DO NOT use the takeScreenshot tool EVER during audit mode. ONLY use it if I specifically ask you to take a screenshot of something.

DO NOT check console or network logs to get started - your main priority is to run the audits in the sequence defined above.

After returning an in-depth analysis, scan through my code and identify various files/parts of my codebase that we want to modify/improve based on the results of our audits.

After identifying what changes may be needed, do NOT make the actual changes. Instead, return back a comprehensive, step-by-step plan to address all of these changes and ask for approval to execute this plan. If feedback is received, make a new plan and ask for approval again. If approved, execute the ENTIRE plan and after all phases/steps are complete, re-run the auditing tools in the same 4 step sequence again before returning back another analysis for additional changes potentially needed.

Keep repeating / iterating through this process with the four tools until our application is as optimized as possible for SEO, accessibility and performance.
